These are scripts I made for mining and organizing genomic data from the NCBI databases regarding the Thiazole and Oxazole Modified Microcins (TOMM) biosynthetic gene cluster.

The data collected was used to construct a genetic family tree of these microbes that produce these TOMM products which was used in a publication.
The article may be viewed [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947797/).  See figure 3.

I don't quite remember what each script here does, but the main two scripts are TOMMfinder.py (queries NCBI databases) and TOMMsorter.py (sifts through results of TOMMfinder).
